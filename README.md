# Adaptive Kalman Filter for Noise Cancellation

This is the implementation of the Adaptive Kalman filter as proposed by Vullings, R. Vullings, B. de Vries and J. W. M. Bergmans (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5667049). This implementation utilizes Bayesian estimation techniques to estimate next state using at least four, simulataneous recorded inputs. The ECG complexes are found using Pan-Tompkins algorithms to find the length of QRS complexes. Following which, a residual analysis is performed to obtain the updated process noise covariance from the recorded input signal. We then iteratively update the Kalman Gain to prefer the estimated signal value instead of the recorded signal, in case the residue (difference between recorded and estimated signal) is too divergent.
